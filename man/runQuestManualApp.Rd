\details{
This application is part of the large set of tools, to facilitate survey implementation with
\href{https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/}{Survey Solutions}. Enumeration Areas, sampled for example
with the JDC-Survey Solutions Spatial Sampling application, can be used to enumerate all buildings
visible within the boundaries on a google map. The enumerate buildings can then be used for the
second stage sampling frame and to draw the survey units within the cluster from it.
